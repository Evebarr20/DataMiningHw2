# Prediction of Titanic Survival - Kaggle Challenge 

## Introduction:
This project is a machine learning challenge hosted by Kaggle, focusing on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine what kinds of people were more likely to survive the disaster based on various passenger data, such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

## Data Set Description:
The data provided for this assignment includes two CSV files:

train.csv - This file contains the training data set, which will be used to build the predictive model.

test.csv - This file contains the test data set, including the ground truth labels for evaluating the model's performance.

## Task:
Your task in this assignment is to design and implement a classification algorithm to predict the survival of Titanic passengers in the test set. You have the flexibility to choose any classification algorithm and utilize any programming language for implementation. While you can use existing tools for data preprocessing, the core classification algorithm must be implemented from scratch without using any machine learning libraries to ensure academic integrity.
